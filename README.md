# DBOG-Tools

Download (Version 1.0.0): [GitHub Release](https://github.com/AmmonNH3/DBOG-Tools/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

This tool provides a macro for the DBOG Gravity Chamber. It uses [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
to read on-screen prompts and automatically execute the correct inputs.

⚠️ Important

If the program does not run correctly for some reason, install TesseractOCR from: [Tesseract OCR Download](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)

Make sure it's installed at:

C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe

The code is fully open source. You may modify or improve it as you wish. Credits would be appreciated.

Windows may flag this program as malicious. I don't really know why, but this is not the case.

-------- INTRODUCTION --------

Welcome to the DBOG gravity macro repo.
I made this because I really got tired of the dumb Gravity Chamber training system, it's hard to get all stats with only 40 minutes on the clock.
The macro uses Tesseract OCR to read prompts displayed on screen and perform the corresponding WASD inputs automatically, I hope this helps you unlock your full potential.

-------- HOW DO I USE IT --------

Watch the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EABeeFTEpxc).

-------- TROUBLESHOOTING --------

- The macro does not recognize a specific letter (e.g., A).

     Select a clearer area for OCR recognition. Tesseract works best when the prompt box is compact, like this:

Instead of doing this, which may cause the OCR to go nuts:

- The macro types too quickly, causing prompts to overlap or misfire.

     Use the built-in presets (Health, Agility, Ki Control, etc.). If that's too fast for you (due to lag or lower-end PC), adjust the Reading Speed slider to your liking.

- The macro does not work in the HTC, or works inconsistently.

     It may happen when the WASD prompt box has a white background.

Try using other colored backgrounds in the HTC, like these ones:

<img width="511" height="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/519e80c4-39e7-4c5f-b816-39a0d2fbbec9" />
<img width="510" height="93" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea9d0e70-4cfa-43d7-b1f5-83dc4ecb36a0" />

- The macro displays "Bot Stopped (Error or manually)" when pressing F4/Start Macro.

     It may be because you didn't run the app as an administrator (the keyboard python library sometimes requires admin perms, idk why)
     Or you don't have Tesseract installed, you can get it [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). (Shouldn't be an issue because the exe already has tesseract incorporated onto it, still, just in case)
